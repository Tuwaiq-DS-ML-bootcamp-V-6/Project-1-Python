# Tourism Recommender System (Project 1)

## Project Introduction & Description

This Tourism Recommender system is designed to guide travelers in selecting the best months to visit various cities in Saudi Arabia based on temperature data. By inputting their preferred travel months, users can receive recommendations for cities with optimal weather conditions, enhancing their travel planning and experience.

## Data Source

The climate data utilized in this project is sourced from the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Open Data Platform](https://open.data.gov.sa/ar/datasets/view/2c95f8d9-c1a9-4c4d-a1d4-b7de55a87136/resources). This data includes historical average temperatures which are key to predicting favorable travel conditions.

## Git Usage in Development

During the development of this project, our team employed a collaborative approach using Git to ensure efficient and error-free integration of various components:

- **Individual Branches**: Each team member created their own branch from the main branch to work on assigned functions independently. This approach allowed us to focus on specific features such as data loading, filtering, and generating reports without interference.
- **Collaboration and Merging**: After completing development and thorough testing of our functions on individual branches, we merged these branches back into the main branch. This was done through pull requests, which were reviewed by peers to maintain code quality and functionality consistency across the project.

This method of using Git branches not only facilitated smooth collaboration among team members but also helped in maintaining a stable main branch throughout the project lifecycle.

## Outcomes

This project effectively demonstrates the application of foundational Python programming skills and Git version control in a real-world scenario, providing a robust solution for a tourism recommender system:

- **Python Basics**:

  - **Data Types**: We adeptly utilized three primary data types `int`, `float`, and `str` which were crucial for handling numerical and textual data.
  - **Data Structures**: Implemented lists for organizing months and dictionaries for storing city temperatures, showcasing our ability to manage and manipulate complex data structures efficiently.
  - **Control Structures**: Used loops to process data iteratively and conditional statements to filter results based on user inputs, ensuring dynamic and responsive system behavior.
  - **Functions and Lambda**: Developed functions that return calculated results, enhancing the modularity and reusability of the code. Additionally, a Lambda function was deployed to calculate mean temperatures, demonstrating efficient functional programming techniques.

- **Git Proficiency**:

  - We applied our knowledge of Git by using branches to work on individual project components independently, facilitating effective collaboration and integration. This approach allowed us to maintain a stable main branch and ensured that all features were integrated seamlessly after thorough peer review and testing.

- **Real-World Application**:
  - The Tourism Recommender System exemplifies how theoretical knowledge in Python and practical skills in Git can be applied to create a valuable tool. This system aids tourists in planning their visits to Saudi Arabia by recommending the best travel times based on climatic conditions, thereby enhancing their travel experience.

This project not only fulfills the project 1 requirements but also extends beyond the classroom by applying these skills to solve practical problems, demonstrating the real-world utility of our learning.

## Project Specifications

This project successfully meets the initial project requirements, showcasing the creative application of Python to address real-world problems:

- **Data Types Used**: The project effectively utilizes at least three primary data types (`int`, `float`, `str`), ensuring robust data handling and operations.
- **Data Structures**: Implements lists and dictionaries, demonstrating efficient management and manipulation of complex data.
- **Control Structures**: Incorporates loops and conditional statements to guide the flow of the program, ensuring dynamic data processing.
- **Functional Programming**: Utilizes a Lambda function to streamline calculations, exemplifying concise and effective programming practices.

## Final Result

The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can select months and cities of interest. It then displays a sorted list of the top five cities with the best average temperatures for the selected time frame, presented in an interactive and visually appealing format.
